# Introduction
We need an introduction.

```{r}
#Use the code below to load the data4led package to your current R session.
library(data4led)

#After entering the seed from the class list of seeds, use the code below to load the data for one randomly selected bulb. 
bulb <- led_bulb(1,seed = 123)
#Setting the seed fixes which randomly selected bulb you will use.
#This makes your work reproducible.

head(bulb)
```

We need to do more.

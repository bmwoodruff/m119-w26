# Activity - Evaluating function with R

We'll be evaluating several functions in R.  Let's start with $w(v) = v^2 - 5v -6$ and evaluate it at $-1, -3, 6, 4$. I'll do the evaulation at all 4 points in a single vector.

```{r}
w <- function(v){v^2 - 5*v -6}
v <- c(-1,-3,6,4)
w(v)
```

The above shows that $w(-1)=0$, ...

Let's do this for a piecewise defined function.  Consider the function
$$f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
x^3 & \quad x < -1 \\ \\
-2 & \quad -1 < x < 4 \\ \\
\sqrt{x} & \quad x \geq 4.
\end{cases}$$
Let's evaluate it at -2.
```{r}
f <- function(x){
  ifelse(x < -1, x^3, ifelse(
         x > -1 & x < 4, -2, ifelse(
         x >= 4, sqrt(x),
         NA)))
}

f(-2)
```
We see that $f(-2)=-8$.
